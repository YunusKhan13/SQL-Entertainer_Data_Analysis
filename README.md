# Entertainer Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a SQL-based data analysis of entertainers. The data is stored in three different tables: `basic_info`, `breakthrough_info`, and `last_work_info`.

## Table Structure
1. `basic_info`: Contains columns `Entertainer`, `Gender (traditional)`, and `Birth Year`.
2. `breakthrough_info`: Contains columns `Entertainer`, `Year of Breakthrough/#1 Hit/Award Nomination`, `Breakthrough Name`, and `Year of First Oscar/Grammy/Emmy`.
3. `last_work_info`: Contains columns `Entertainer`, `Year of Last Major Work (arguable)`, `Year of Death`.

## Case Studies
